    Data is the currency of the information economy and the price of admission to much of the web.&nbsp;
    Now you can give a copy of this asset to non-profit and research groups to help them advance their work.&nbsp;
    Imagine donating your Nike+ data to a study on heart health, or your LinkedIn data to a study on professional development.&nbsp;
    DataDonor screens the research groups that are admitted into the program; you decide which data to upload and share.&nbsp;
    DataDonor is in private beta, but if you're interested, we'll keep you in the loop.&nbsp;
